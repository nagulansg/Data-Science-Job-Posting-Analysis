# Data-Science-Job-Posting-Analysis
My team and I used a dataset of web scraped data of data science related job postings. 
We cleaned and transformed the data, and tried several predictive models such as k-NN, regression,
trees and random forests to get a good prediction of salary given job description.
I have not attached the process files yet, but the slides show the steps taken and our performance metrics
